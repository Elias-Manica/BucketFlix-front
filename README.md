## About this Project

This is a Single-Page Application that simulates a social network. Below are the implemented features:

- Login
- Sign up
- HomeScreen
- See what movies people are watching by category
- Search for a specific movie
- Search for specific users
- Add/remove a movie to your bucket list
- Add/remove a movie to your list of watched movies
- Review and comment on your favorite movies
- Follow profile of your friends
- Share your lists with your friends 

## Why?

This project was made to help me decide what I should watch and what my friends are watching. I can manage movies I want to watch and movies I've watched. In addition to everything, make comments on those I hated so that no one has to spend more than 4 hours watching (Justice League-Snyder Cut)

This web site was my project Full Stack doing everything from the ideia, layout, backend, frontend to the deploy in the AWS, using PostgresSQL! 

The Back-end can be found here:

I will be happy if you can give me some feedback on the code, layout or anything you think could have been better in the project.

I am always available to answer questions
